Hello I didn't use the Readme.md but here is my readme so far I only have a wordlist that can crack any Arris TG1672G32 router or modem...
Their keyspace is pretty simple so it won't take long depending on what setup uou have on my Desktop it takes anywhere from 1-5 minutes
I tried it on my laptop and it took 15 so it all depends anyways hopefully I will be adding more Keyspaces/Wordlists.
