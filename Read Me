Hello I Didn't Use The Readme.md But Here Is My Readme So Far I Only Have A Wordlist That Can Crack Any Arris TG1672G32 Router Or Modem...
Their Keyspace Is Pretty Simple So It Won't Take Long Depending On What Setup You Have I Have A GTX 1080 Titan SC Black So It Takes Anywhere From 1-5 Minutes
I Tried It On My Laptop With No Graphics Card And A i3 And It Took 15 So It All Depends Anyways Hopefully I Will Be Adding More Keyspaces/Wordlists.
